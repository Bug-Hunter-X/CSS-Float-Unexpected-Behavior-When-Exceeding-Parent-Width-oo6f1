The following CSS rule may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the total width of the floated `div` elements exceeds the width of their parent container.  In this case, some browsers might introduce extra space or unexpected wrapping behavior.
