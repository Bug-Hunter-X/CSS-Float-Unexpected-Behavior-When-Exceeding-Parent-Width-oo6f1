# CSS Float Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with CSS floats. When using `float: left;` and the total width of floated elements exceeds the parent container's width, some browsers might behave unexpectedly.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS. `bugSolution.css` shows a possible solution.  See the files for more details.
